# Birthday-wisher-using-python
I used this code to wish my friends on birthday through Gmail using Python.
Here I filled all my friends birthday date and email records in separate file known as "Birthday.csv"
I used Panda module to read emails and date and time from "birthday.csv".
SMTP module is used is used to send mail from my mail to my friend mail in which panda module is used to read the data from the csv file.
